# JSPit - a roguelike Pit made in JavaScript

This is my current ( as of 2020-10 ) development sandbox for learning and
experimenting with game programming. This time targeting a browser game,
loosely as a successor to [a prior
experiment](https://github.com/jcorbin/execs/blob/twentyone) in building a
terminal game and an ECS.

Status: early rumination, pre-code; see [stream.md](stream.md) for the development log.
