# JSPit - a roguelike Pit made in JavaScript

**Play** at [jcorbin.github.io/jspit](https://jspit.vercel.app).

This is my current ( as of 2020-10 ) development sandbox for learning and
experimenting with game programming. This time targeting a browser game,
loosely as a successor to [a prior
experiment](https://github.com/jcorbin/execs/blob/twentyone) in building a
terminal game and an ECS.

**Status**: minimally viable shell, still in tech exploration mode, while
ruminating on game design in the background; see [stream.md](stream.md) for the
development log.
