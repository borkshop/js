      <p>
      Originally an experiment to explore a cooperative thunk system to
      implement simple behavioral AI...
      </p>

      <p>
      But to exercise such an AI system, we need a world to set it within...
      </p>

      <p>
      And I'd been wanting to build a world where AI only sees as much a state
      as the human does...
      </p>

      <p>The road so far:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>this demo is currently little more than a redeployed copy of the
          offline test suite</li>

        <li>currently the only two thunk behaviors developed are the player
          proxy and a random wanderer...</li>

        <li>...read that again: an interesting property that fell out of this
          approach is that "the player is just another minded entity, whose
          mind thinks about key input events, and processes view data into an
          output element"; this means that transference of play control should
          be as simple as rebinding input and swapping behavior</li>

        <li>a component-entity system that has a degree of ocap-inspired
          hardening so that no entity has access to all/raw data</li>
        <li>in fact each entity never even knows its own id, let alone can it
          truly identify other entities; instead it only observes the world
          through incoming event data, including view-field sensing</li>

        <li>side modules generated:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>a shadow-casting and spatial index package reprised out of <tt>cdom</tt></li>
          <li>a bigint port of xorshiro256+ to provide each entity with an independent RNG</li>
          <li>this demo itself has a cute spinner/text-bouncer that could be
            liberated... maybe you already noticed?</li>
        </ul>

      </ul>
