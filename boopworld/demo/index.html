        <p>
        Originally an experiment to explore a cooperative thunk system to
        implement simple behavioral AI...
        </p>

        <p>
        But to exercise such an AI system, we need a world to set it within...
        </p>

        <p>
        And I'd been wanting to build a world where AI only sees as much a state
        as the human does...

      <details><summary>The road so far:</summary>
        <ul>

          <li>this demo is currently little more than a redeployed copy of the
            offline test suite</li>

          <li>currently the only two thunk behaviors developed are the player
            proxy and a random wanderer...</li>

          <li>...read that again: an interesting property that fell out of this
            approach is that "the player is just another minded entity, whose
            mind thinks about key input events, and processes view data into an
            output element"; this means that transference of play control should
            be as simple as rebinding input and swapping behavior</li>

          <li>a component-entity system that has a degree of ocap-inspired
            hardening so that no entity has access to all/raw data</li>
          <li>in fact each entity never even knows its own id, let alone can it
            truly identify other entities; instead it only observes the world
            through incoming event data, including view-field sensing</li>

          <li>side modules generated:
            <ul>
              <li>a more spartan <tt>domkit</tt> of general browser quality of
                life factored out of <tt>cdom</tt></li>
              <li>a shadow-casting and spatial index package reprised out of <tt>cdom</tt></li>
              <li>a bigint port of xorshiro256+ to provide each entity with an independent RNG</li>
              <li>this demo itself has a cute spinner/text-bouncer that could be
                liberated... maybe you already noticed?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
