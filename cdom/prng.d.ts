/**
 * This variation on the xorshift128+ psuedo-random number generator provides
 * an API that allows the user to inject more entropy into the generator's
 * state between extractions.
 *
 * The generator provides an API suitable for use both as a random number
 * generator and also a hash digest.
 * As a random number generator, it accepts a seed and returns an object
 * implementing `random()`, like `Math.random()`.
 * To preserve integer integrity, it also provides `randomUint32()`, which
 * returns the noiser high 32 bits of randomness from the underlying 64 bits of
 * randomness provided by a crank of the xorshift128+ algorithm.
 *
 * As a hash digest, like one that implements {`update()` and `digest()`}, the
 * generator provides `update(array)`, which will fold an arbitrary amount of
 * entropy into its own state from an array or typed array of 32 bit unsigned
 * integers.
 * The `random()` function serves as `digest()`, but doesn't leave the
 * generator in a useless state.
 *
 * In addition, `fork()` will create a new branch of the generator sequence
 * beginning with the same state, and is useful for testing.
 *
 * Once significant difference in this implementation to the prior version by
 * Andreas Madsen & Emil Bay is that there is no method that returns an duple
 * of [high and low] unsigned 32 bit integers, owing to a prejudice against
 * unnecessary allocation.
 * Instead, pass a reusable array or typed array to the `scribble` method.
