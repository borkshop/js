## TODO

- mixing
- spreading
- riffle
- cut

## WIP

- dnd wrt piles and grid space

## Done

- html5 dnd demo

# 2021-04-03

- minor plumbing changes while exploring dnd

# 2021-04-02

- added pile click plumbing, ensuring that the top card gets clicked
- broke out index.{css and js}

# 2021-04-01

- pile cards up initially

# 2021-03-31

- minor cleanups and refactors while exploring interaction side paths
- experimented with a stack-based acceptor/invoker abstraction, which may still
  be worthwhile, but discovered that z-ordering doesn't invert by rotateY
  transform, so having formal piles of cards may not be useful
- prototyped a click-menu system, but holding it back until more than one
  interaction warrants it

# 2021-03-30

- let cards be flipped
- scraped https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/xr/index.htm
- sorted out basic card physics
