<P ALIGN="CENTER">4th Hebrew letter (Daleth).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE FOURTH CARD OF THE TAROT.</P>
<P>The hieroglyphic meaning of Daleth is the womb. It suggests the idea of an object giving plentiful nourishment, the source of future growth. The child is the living</P>
<P><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></P>
<P>link, which in its neutrality reunites the opposition of the sexes; the Daleth therefore denotes abundance springing from division.</P>
<P>Like the 1, it is a sign of active creation; but this creation is the result of previous actions easily determinable, whilst the origin of the Unity is inaccessible to human conceptions. The Daleth expresses a creation made by a created being. according to divine laws.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="tob17.htm#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>The Daleth should be the image of the active vivifying principle of the Universe, Jupiter, the reflex of the Primal cause.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE FOURTH CARD OF THE TAROT.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">The Emperor</I>.</P>
<P>This symbol should express in the <I>active</I> form all that the preceding card expressed in the <I>passive</I>.</P>
<P>A man seated in profile.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The man indicates the active; his position, however, shows that this activity is engendered by a superior term. The 1st arcanum, the Juggler, the <I>active absolute</I>, was represented <I>standing</I>, looking to the front; the 4th arcanum, <I>active relative</I>, is seated in profile.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>This man holds in his right hand the sceptre, the symbol of generation or of Venus &#9792;.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The sceptre is held in the <I>right hand</I>, to indicate the <I>active</I> influence, which the vivifying principle exercises in nature, by opposition to the formative principle (arc. 3).</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The man is bearded and wears a helmet with twelve points (six on each side). He is seated upon a cubic stone, which bears the figure of an eagle.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The helmet indicates the rule of the Divine Will in the Universe, and its universal action in the creation of Life (eagle).</P>
<P>The position upon the cubic stone indicates realization in all the worlds.</P>
<P>(1st) Realization of the Divine Word by the creation.</P>
<P>(2nd) Realization of the ideas of the Being shared by the quadruple work of the spirit--</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Affirmation,--Negation,<BR>

Solution.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(3rd) Realization of the actions conceived by the Will.</P></DIR>

<P>The man's legs are crossed, his body forms a triangle <A NAME="img_12100"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/12100.jpg">.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Domination of the Spirit over Matter.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Considered more attentively, the figure reproduces the symbol of Jupiter 2 +, represented by the fourth card of the Tarot.</P>
<P>The fourth card of the Tarot corresponds to the <I>second He</I>, and therefore bears two, very distinct aspects.</P>
<P>It first expresses a term of transition uniting the first series (active and passive forces, the link between the two forces) to the following series; the passage from one world to the other.</P>
<P>But it also represents this term of transition, itself becoming the first term in the following series. As the following series taken as a whole is negative relatively to the first, the fourth symbol represents the active influence of the first series 1, 2, 3, in the second series 4, 5, 6.</P>
<P>The 4 therefore expresses the reflections of the first card in all its details. It acts towards the first series exactly as the second card acted towards the first.</P>
<P>This interprets its meaning--</P>
