<P ALIGN="CENTER">7th Hebrew letter (Zain).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE SEVENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.</P>
<P>Hieroglyphically the Zain expresses an arrow, and therefore it suggests the idea of a <I>weapon</I>, of the instrument which man uses <I>to rule and conquer</I>, and to attain his object.</P>
<P>The Zain expresses victory in all the worlds. As a simple letter it corresponds with the astronomic sign of the Twins in the Zodiac.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">SEVENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">The Chariot</I>.</P>
<P>The symbolism of this card corresponds in all points with the ideas which it expresses.</P>
<P>A Conqueror, crowned with a coronet, upon which rise three shining Pentagrams of gold, advances in a cubical chariot, surmounted by an azure, star-decked canopy supported by four columns.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This symbol reproduces the 1st and 21st arcana in another order of ideas. The four columns represent the four animals of the 1st arcanum, and the four symbols of the 1st arcanum, symbols of the <I>quaternary</I> in all its acceptations.</P>
<P>The Conqueror, who occupies the centre of the four elements, is the man who has vanquished and directed the elementary forces: this victory is confirmed by the cubical <A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A> form of the chariot, and by the Pentagrams, which crown the Initiate.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The Conqueror has three right angles upon his cuirass, and he bears upon his shoulders the Urim and Thummim of the sovereign sacrificant, represented by the two crescents of the moon on the right and left; in his hand is a sceptre surmounted by a globe, a square, and a triangle. Upon the square, which forms the front of the chariot, we see the Indian <I>lingam</I>, surmounted by the flying sphere of Egypt.</P>
<P>Two sphinxes, one white, the other black, are harnessed to the chariot.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This symbol represents the sacred septenary in all its manifestations. The word <I>Yod-he-vau-he</I> is portrayed upon the front of the chariot by the winged globe, to indicate that the septenary gives the key to the whole Tarot. The two sphinxes correspond to the two principles, active and passive. The Conqueror corresponds especially with the <I>Sword</I> and the Vau of the sacred name.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The 7th card of the Tarot shows the influence of the creation in the preservation of the Divine in the Human. It represents the <I>Yod</I> or the God of the 2nd septenary.</P>
<P>THE GOD <I>of the 2nd septenary</I>.</P>
<P>Man performing the function of God the Creator.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE FATHER.</P>
<I><P>The law of the 2nd septenary</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">REALIZATION.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Reflex of the Power.)</P>
<I><P>The Man of the 2nd septenary</I>.</P>
<P>Nature performing the function of Adam.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE ASTRAL LIGHT.</P>

<P>The passage from one world to the other is scarcely performed, when we see the same law in action that we found in the 1st septenary. The second terra of this series will be <I>the reflection</I> of the first, just as the second term of the first series also reflected the first. However, since this 2nd septenary is the central one, we shall find as the foundation of all its constituent arcana, the idea of mediation or equilibrium. This is shown by the eighth card.</P>
