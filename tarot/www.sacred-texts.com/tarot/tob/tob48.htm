<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE HIEROGRAM OF ADAM, BY</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">STANISLAS DE GUAITA.</P>
<P>In asserting that the hierogram of Adam conceals the most profound arcana of the living Universe, we shall not astonish those who have made a serious study of the <I>Sepher Bereschit</I>. By comparing the admirable translation of Fabre d'Olivet with the pentacular revelations of the <I>Book of Thoth</I>, it is not impossible to strike out the supreme light of truth. Here are a few data which will aid us to reach it.</P>
<P>Adam &#1488;&#1491;&#1502; is written in Hebrew, <I>Aleph</I>, <I>Daleth</I>, <I>Mem</I>.</P>
<P>&#1488; (1st key of the Tarot: The Juggler). God and man; the Principle and the end; the Equilibrant Unity.</P>
<P>&#1491; (4th key of the Tarot: The Emperor). The Power and the Kingdom; the verbal Quaternary; the Multiplication of the cube.</P>
<P>&#1502; (13th key of the Tarot: Death). Destruction and Restoration; Night and Day, moral and physical; Eternity and the Ephemeral; feminine Passivity; at once the gulf of the Past, the matrix of the Future.</P>
<P>The ternary analysis of the fathomless principle that Yod manifests in its inaccessible and synthetic unity, <I>Adam</I>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A></P>
<P>is, in fact, very analogous to the hierogram <I>Aum</I>, which is so famous in the sanctuaries of India.</P>
<P>In &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;, <I>Aleph</I> corresponds to the Father, the source of the Trinity; <I>Daleth</I> to the Son (whom the Kabbalah also names the King); and <I>Mem</I> to the Holy Spirit, whose ethereal body, devouring yet fertilizing transitory forms, causes life (inexhaustible and unalterable in its essence) to blossom upon the changing hot-bed of <I>Growth</I>.</P>
<P>I have said that &#1488;&#1491;&#1502; is the cyclic analysis of the principle, of which &#1497; (Yod) is the inaccessible synthesis.</P>
<P>A simple calculation of the numerical Kabbalah confirms my assertion. Let us translate the letters into numbers (Tarotic method).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&#1488; 1 &#1491; 4 &#1502; 13.<BR>
1 + 4 + 13 = 18. In 18, 1 +8= 9.</P>
<P>In Kabbalistic absolute numericals the analytical number of Adam is then 9. Now we obtain 10 by adding, to 9 the specific unity which leads the cycle back to its starting-point, and closes analysis in synthesis, and 10 is the number which corresponds to the letter Yod: this we were anxious to prove.</P>
<P>The hierogrammatic vocable &#1488;&#1491;&#1502; (Adam) then represents the ninth evolution of the cycle, which emanated from &#1497; (Yod), and which closes in 10 by returning to its starting-point. Principle and end of all, the eternal Yod, revealed in its expanded form <I>tertriune</I>.</P>
<P>Let us go further still.</P>
<P>We have then the right (noting, however, that Adam differs from Yod, or from Wodh, as the totality of the sub-multiples differ from the Unity),--we have the right to say, pursuing our analogies,</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">If Adam be equal to</I> 1,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_296"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 296</FONT></A></P>
<I><P>Adam-ah</I> = <I>I-ah</I>; and <I>Adam Eve</I> = <I>I-eve</I>. He (&#1492;) represents Universal Life, <I>natura naturans</I>; &#1497;&#1492; then represents Yod united to Life, and &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; (Adamah), Adam united to Life. This is the union of the Spirit and of the Universal Soul at two different degrees (always remembering the distinction noticed above).</P>
<P>Lastly, in &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (IEVE), as in &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;-&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (Adam-Eve), Vau (&#1493;) represents the fecundity of this union, and the last He (&#1492;) symbolizes <I>natura naturata</I> (issued from <I>natura naturans</I>, increased by the mixed principle).</P>
<P>These four letters, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (IEVE), symbolize the quaternary of <I>Mercavah</I>, the six letters of Adam-Eve, &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;-&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, the senary of <I>Bereschith</I>.</P>
