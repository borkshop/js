<p>TRADITION: The town, native land, living place, residence; also citizen(ship). Reversed: Agitation, irritation, indignation, anger. Another version gives: "Husband and wife . . ." "Contentment, repose of the entire heart"; and "A person who is taking care of the querent's interests." (<i>W</i>.)</p>  
<p>THEORY: It is the <i>Water</i> on the <i>Sixth house</i>, where it meets with Virgo-influences. Now what about the town or city? Virgo is "the city which killed the prophets"--Jerusalem--and the addiction originally will have indicated the physical, sensual embodiment of the soul, in which the spirit is 'buried' or 'killed' as the mystic formula has it. This card may therefore be called, with truth, the indication of 'the city of God' which, by analogy, becomes the physical body, as well as one's residence or native land. It means the physical and sensatory possession or ownership. Consequently it has to do with the agreeable sensation of being 'at home' and 'at ease,' having possession of what is wanted. It must also mean being fully acquainted with one's work. Good health and wise living. This house rules servants, food, health.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Well-earned security, wise living, husbandry, being at ease, feeling safe; "a person who is taking care of the querent's interests" may be correct and actually present, e.g., in the shape of servants, shopmen, purveyors.

<p><i>body and soul. Organic life in the body and in the community, viz. practical social conditions. In weak cases the house of Virgo may cause irritability and agitation, etc.: a weak nervous system must avoid the full sway of emotions</i>.</p>
