<p>TRADITION: Victory, success, advantage, gain, triumph, superiority, etc. "The heart's content." (<i>W</i>.) Reversed, the card seems even better: Sincerity, truth, loyalty, good faith, frankness, ingenuity, opening the heart, liberty, familiarity, etc. Concord, contentment, physical well-being.</p>  
<p>THEORY: Many of the addictions are very suggestive of the influence of the <i>Water</i> on the house of the heart, <i>the Fifth</i>; and we can only say, that they are fairly exact and to the point. The card must signify the realisation of hopes and wishes lying in one's own power or destiny, making one enjoy the fulness of life, and adopting the philosophy of Epicurus. There is no evil in it. It shows goodness and a jovial disposition, not only contentment and happiness in one's self, but also, owing to Leo-influence, the love of bestowing hospitality on other people and helping them.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Happiness, contentment, the fulfilment of wishes, bestowing benefits, hospitality, the heart's content,' loyalty, liberality, the joy of life, love of children; concord, well-being; success, advantage, satisfaction, etc. Joviality</i>.</p>  
<p>P.S.--In the more profane branch of divination this card is called the '<i>nine-months-card</i>,' owing to the belief that it means <i>pregnancy and expectance of childbirth</i>. The latter is significant of the fifth house,</p>

<p>the former confirms our idea, that the cups have to do with months in time.</p>
