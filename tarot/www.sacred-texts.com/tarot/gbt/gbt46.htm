<p>TRADITION: Embarrassment, obstacles, obstruction, emotion, confusion, difficulty, hindrance, unrest, etc. Reversed it is given as message, writing, doctrine,</p>

<p>THEORY: The <i>Fire</i> on the <i>Sixth house</i>, the house of Virgo. Now here the so-called reversed meanings in the tradition seem to hold the most current significances of this house. Which once more warns us against attaching too great, if any, importance to the idea of 'reversed' position. The tradition does not give a very clear conception here, on the whole. The word 'emotion' is not in its place; as to embarrassment, this is correct: the influence of the sunny and Venusian fire on this house of infinite possibilities must naturally cause 'embarras du choix,' the difficulty of choice, and the one possibility hindering the other; giving too much force and attention to little or subordinate things and persons. There can be very little harm, however, in any card of the pentacles suit; the greatest evil done here might be that too little profit is earned in proportion to the labour given to it. On the other hand this card must necessarily mean good and conscientious work and fidelity of servants, agreeable and satisfactory work, reasonable remuneration, and consequently joy. The agreeable stimulation which it gives to the nervous system must cause gaiety, recreation, etc. Good health is also one of the results.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Good work, reasonable satisfaction, satisfactory results, agreeable occupations, but a warning to use economy in the display of one's forces, means, money and health; difficulty of choice; trustworthy</i>&nbsp;</p>
