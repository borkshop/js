<p>TRADITION: Country woman, honest, economical woman, honourable and loving, virtuous, chaste, good and inclined to be friendly and interest herself in the querent. The card may also indicate love of money, economy and gifts.</p>  
<p>THEORY: Queen of <i>Air</i> on the <i>Second house</i> of economy, money, country life and art. Some of the traditional renderings certify this remarkably well. Now what does a queen in general mean? In divination a woman simply, but in general, as the king is the head of the hierarchy or suit as the spiritual synthesis and masculine representative, so the queen may be said to be the material synthesis and the chief female representative.

<p>CONCLUSION: <i>A woman of economical habits, wealthy or desiring wealth, steadily resolved to get at riches, certainly not 'cheap'; more or less artistic, may be a painter, dancer or musician; she is faithful, but may be subject to moods and changes of taste. Honesty may be certified, but not without a certain amount of egotism, e.g. materialism. She is very passive and cool, phlegmatic and not easily to be roused to passion, if ever. This of course makes the impression of 'chaste.' There is, however, a solid sort of sensuality. In strong cases there is real virtue. Banking, agriculture, art, capital, money</i>. The latter more to be seen as 'money-matters' than as 'ready money,' and rather papers of value, shares, bonds, banknotes, than coined money.</p>
