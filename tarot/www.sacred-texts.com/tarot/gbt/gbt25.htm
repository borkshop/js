<p>Everything that has been said in astrology about the Moon might be repeated here, as there exists no controversy whatever on the point of identity. "The card represents life of the imagination apart from life of the spirit." (<i>W</i>.)</p>  
<p>This card consequently means the life of the soul in particular, the feelings and sentiments, emotions (not only fear, etc.), changes wrought in existence by them, water and the female element in general. In the horoscopic figure it may be the mother or some other woman prominent in the life of the querent; it may signify women in general (and morally or psychically, while Saturn means physical woman). It is the sign of <i>panta rei</i>: everything passing, flowing or ebbing away in life, consequently uncertainty. It may relate to dreams, to exhibitions, popular plays, and games, theatres, and to the lower class of people. Physically it means the brain and the stomach.</p>  
<p>The hieroglyphic value of the Hebrew letter <i>Tzaddi</i>, connected with this card, "is the same as that of <i>Thet</i> (ninth card) . . . which perhaps may account for the relationship of the Moon with that</p>

<p>house, as pointed out by us before. It should mean a term, an aim, an end." (<i>P</i>.) But this does not make it much clearer.</p>  
<p><i>P</i>. has only one good thing on it, and after all this is only on a particular and not very high level: "Servile spirits (the dog), savage souls (the wolf), and crawling creatures (the crayfish) are all present watching the fall of the soul, hoping to aid in its destruction." That is true. And it may happen to us, that a lower current of the Moon brings our way people who have no higher aim than to 'aid in our destruction' even if we ourselves have no intention whatever of 'falling'.</p>
