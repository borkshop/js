<p>TRADITION: Money, riches, sums of money, also silver especially. Has to do with the moon and whiteness. Candour, innocence, purgation, purification. Business, barter. Reversed: Mental worries, suspicion, diligence, fear, mistrust, etc.</p>  
<p>THEORY: The <i>Fire</i> with its sunny and Venusian character on the <i>Eleventh house</i>, the house of friends, in which the Self has to rely for a good deal on them or to live for them, but in which it sometimes finds it hard to give up its own desires and wishes. Still in the main it contains 'friendly' surroundings and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is the house of traffic and business, of practical co-operation and interrelation. Aquarius is the house of the Angels too, and this may account perhaps for such renderings as innocence, purgation, etc., and may mean that the individualistic and egotistic elements have to be modified into something more 'brotherly.' What we have to do with the moon and its metal silver here, is less clear, unless the idea has been induced by the electric-blue colour of this house, or by the fact that it is the first house of the lunar body in the solar system. Neither can we very clearly see why it should indicate riches, money, etc. This is probably a rather coarse transmission of the idea, that friendly relations together with the person's own good intentions and good-will must produce advantages in material things. So the card must indicate good business, profitable friendship, assistance and help of friends and <i>vice versa;</i> reliable and agreeable surroundings outside the family circle. The advantages will probably be the outcome of what has been sown before by good action. For 'fear, mistrust,' etc., we can see no reason.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Friendship, concord, friendly relations and sympathetic, reliable and agreeable surroundings outside the family circle; profitable co-operation, advantage, good business, remuneration. Natural and rational outcome of what has been sown previously</i>.</p>
