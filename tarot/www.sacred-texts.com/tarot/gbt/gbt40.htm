<p>TRADITION: Treachery, duplicity, perfidy, falsehood, disguise, imposture, conspiration, obstacle, surprise, dissimulation, contrarieties, difficulties, false-seeming, oppression. ". . . and if there is question of a lawsuit, there will be certain loss." (<i>W</i>.)</p>  
<p>THEORY: <i>Air</i> on the house of Capricorn: the <i>Tenth</i>. It is well known by astrologers, that the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></p>  
<p>tenth house rules the actions, deeds and attitude. Also the name and official position of the personality in the world and at the same time the superiors or authorities, met with on account of position and activities. Actions and deeds, under the influence of the double-natured mercurial element, may easily degrade into 'double-dealing' and everything else of that nature. But once more it appears to us, that the gypsy tradition is rather too much exclusively on the lower side of things. The qualities mixed here make very often an egoistic blend and a nature which reveals several weaknesses, as soon as it comes under trial. So the card on the one hand means certainly that the attitude of mind or action will be untrustworthy and must not be relied upon. There is fear and cowardice in it. But on the other hand the combination is that of mental ability, quick perception, etc. It means also the load of the earthy responsibility laid upon the shoulders of an airy creature, consequently 'oppression' is a word very much to the point here. And this explains even why weaker natures are driven to undesirable, unreliable actions and reactions by it; they cannot stand the pressure. Strong natures, however, accept the pressure as natural necessity, karma, and carry their burden. This is symbolised by the man carrying the ten wands. It is a symbol of executive ability, production, the doing of necessary things, obedience to official order and rule; officials, 'red tape' and burdens that appear heavier than they actually are.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Karma, obedience, executive ability, production and reproduction, necessity; officials and official position</i>. In weaker cases: <i>Duplicity, falsehood</i>,</p>
