<p>TRADITION: Inheritance, legacy, succession, gift, testament, transmission, tradition; all of them "not corresponding to expectations; with some it is a card of marriage, but not without bitterness or frustration." (<i>W</i>.) Reversed: Family, forefathers, ancestry. Liaison, alliance, affinity, acquaintance, consanguinity. Race. "It is a card of loss." (<i>W</i>.)</p>  
<p>THEORY: The <i>Water</i> coming on the <i>First house</i>, the <i>ascendant</i>, and water having to do with the family, we may conclude, that family matters will come naturally to the querent in this case, just as they were swept from him or evaded by him in the preceeding one. Still we cannot see, that the card should denote the members of the family in particular, as mentioned by <i>P</i>. and others. Now 'family-matters' may include inheritance as well as marriage, but so many other things may also be included that it is difficult to enumerate them, and none of them is</p>

<p>indicated particularly. So we do not think it wise to say anything more definitely about this. The water of the feelings coming on the ascendant indicates sensitiveness and emotion, which may bring sorrow A or pleasure, but generally mixed experiences and not without care. There may be material losses in consequence.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Family-matters, care to be taken of them, sorrow or pleasure, emotion, material difficulties; there may be some advantage and some loss at the same time. News is certain to arrive. Subject to influences from the surroundings and apt to react too quickly thereon</i>.</p>
