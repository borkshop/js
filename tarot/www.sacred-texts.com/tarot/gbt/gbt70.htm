<p>TRADITION: Fair woman, good honest and devoted; virtuous and one who will do service to the querent; another version says: "Loving intelligence, and hence the gift of vision; success, happiness, pleasure, also wisdom, virtue." (<i>W</i>.) Reversed: Vice, corruption, scandal, etc. A rich marriage.</p>  
<p>THEORY: The personification of the soul on the house of Capricorn, the <i>Tenth</i>, manifesting into the world that which it carries. As such this queen is to us the image of the married woman and the mother and of all that which woman can give to man and mankind, by her virtue both of soul and body. So the card must also mean the realisation of hopes and wishes, consequently success, etc. The 'wisdom'</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is here more of the practical blend, usefulness, knowing how to act with care and prudence. The card may represent a woman, or an impersonal power or authority, whom the querent has to obey, or to whom it will be to his advantage to submit. It expresses a tendency to go out into the world and make a name and position for oneself, and indicates the right moment to do so. It is fairly certain that it will ensure some publicity, renown, fame, or even glory or theatrical success, but of 'scandal' we see no indication whatever in the card itself, though of course 'publicity' connected with very evil influences might end in something like that. In such cases, however, we must not ascribe the effect to the card, which means publicity, but to that of the evil influences. It is a mistake, which we very often meet in the traditional interpretations, to ascribe effects, resulting from certain combinations of influences to one card which is only one of the composing causes.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>A good, intelligent, active and practical woman (may be fair), whom the querent will do well to obey and who deserves his full esteem. Type of the married woman and mother. Careful and attentive, of much use to the querent. Loving intelligence; and practical wisdom. Success, pleasure, happiness, virtue. Natural growth, promotion in the world, position and name, fame or renown</i>.</p>
