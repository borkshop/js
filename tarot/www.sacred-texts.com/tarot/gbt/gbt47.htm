<p>TRADITION: Nobility, noblesse, good and generous action, aristocracy, fame, glory, splendour, etc. Consideration, generous action. The reversed meanings do not appear at all to respond to a card of pentacle-nature and, as in many other cases, simply seem to imply the absence of the better qualities: weakness, humility, vile and abject action, etc. Another version gives: "M&eacute;tier, trade, skilled labour." (<i>W</i>.)</p>  
<p>THEORY: The <i>Fire</i> on the <i>Seventh house</i>, which rules the contact of the Self and the Not-self, the relations between both, the executive ability in man. So this must lead to the idea of well-doing and noble demeanour, owing to the Sun and Venus again. Compare horoscopes with the Sun and Venus in VII. Well-conducted relations denote civilisation, aristocracy, and the proper expression of one's relation to the world in his occupation, his m&eacute;tier, as <i>W</i>. has it; profession, marriage and employment. So this card has to do with 'workmanship,' which is well expressed by the drawing of the card in the set of <i>W</i>.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Civilisation, aristocracy, good workmanship, skill, civil treatment and noblesse, agreeable relation, m&eacute;tier, employment, profession, marriage; good done to other people, bounty, profitable relations in business; restoration, reparation, beneficial arrangement. A marriage will do much good</i>.</p>
