<p>TRADITION: Discussion, negotiation, conference, conversation, deliberation, dissertation; measure; correspondence, words and language; generally success, but there may be also some hesitation, uncertainty, irresolution, light-heartedness.</p>  
<p>THEORY: All this is very strikingly typifying the element <i>Air</i> on the <i>Seventh house</i>, that of the airy Libra, house of relationship, marriage, meeting of the Self and the Not-self, which rules contracts, books and manuscripts. Here only comes 'discussion' into play. In the Fifth house the individuality was alone, and for discussion you want two persons.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Discussion, relation, negotiation, entertainment, discourse, lecture, reasonable explanation, contract, marriage proposed, society-rulership and orders given out to inferiors, arrangements, regularisation and measurement; measure, proportion, rules given for conduct</i>. There is <i>uncertainty or opportunism</i> in so far as rules are given in relation to circumstances, which may change. The personal interests are brought in, in relation with those of others. <i>Fair weather</i>.</p>
