<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CARD XV.</H3>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE DEVIL.</H1>
<P>Black, awful night enveloped the earth. An ominous, red flame burned in the distance. I was approaching a fantastic figure which outlined itself before me as I came nearer to it. High above the earth appeared the repulsive red face of the Devil, with large, hairy ears, pointed beard and curved goats' horns. A pentagram, pointing downwards, shone in phosphoric light between the horns on his forehead. Two large, grey, bat-like wings were spread behind him. He held up one arm, spreading out his bare, fat hand. In the palm I saw the sign of black magic. A burning torch held down-end in his other hand emitted black, stifling smoke. He sat on a large, black cube, gripping it with the claws of his beast-like, shaggy legs.</P>
<P>A man and woman were chained to the cube--the same Man and Woman I saw in the garden, but now they had horns and tails tipped with flame. And they were evidently dissatisfied in spirit, and were filled with protest and repulsion.</P>
<P>"This is a picture of weakness", said the voice, "a picture of falsehood and evil. They are the same man and</P>

<P>woman you saw in the garden, but their love ceasing to be a sacrifice, became an illusion. This man and woman forgot that their love is a link in the chain that unites them with eternity, that their love is a symbol of equilibrium and a road to Infinity.</P>
<P>"They forgot that It is a key to the gate of the magic world, <I>the torch which lights the higher Path</I>. They forgot that Love is real and immortal and they subjugated it to the unreal and temporary. And they each made love a tool for submitting the other to himself.</P>
<P>"Then love became dissension and fettered them with iron chains to the black cube of matter, on which sits deceit".</P>
<P>And I heard the voice of the Devil: "I am Evil", he said, "at least so far as Evil can exist in this best of worlds. In order to see me, one must be able to see unfairly, incorrectly and narrowly. I close the triangle, the other two sides of which are Death and Time. In order to quit this triangle it is necessary to see that it does not exist.</P>
<P>"But how to do this is not for me to tell. For I am the Evil which men say is the cause of all evil and which they invented as an excuse for all the evil that they do.</P>
<P>"They call me the Prince of Falsehood, and truly I am the prince of lies, because I am the most monstrous production of human lies".</P>
