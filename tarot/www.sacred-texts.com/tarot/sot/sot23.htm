<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE HANGED MAN.</H1>
<P>And then I saw a man in terrible suffering, hung by one leg, head downward, to a high tree. And I heard the voice:--</P>
<P>"Look! This is a man who saw Truth. Suffering awaits the man on earth, who finds the way to eternity and to the understanding of the Endless.</P>
<P>"He is still a man, but he already knows much of what is inaccessible even to Gods. And the incommensurableness of the small and the great in his soul constitutes his pain and his golgotha.</P>
<P>"In his own soul appears the gallows on which he hangs in suffering, feeling that he is indeed inverted.</P>
<P>"He chose this way himself.</P>
<P>"For this he went over a long road from trial to trial, from initiation to initiation, through failures and falls.</P>
<P>"And now he has found Truth and knows himself.</P>
<P>"He knows that it is he who stands before an altar with magic symbols, and reaches from earth to heaven; that he also walks on a dusty road under a scorching sun to a precipice where a crocodile awaits</P>
<P><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></P>
<P>him; that he dwells with his mate in paradise under the shadow of a blessing genius; that he is chained to a black cube under the shadow of deceit; that he stands as a victor for a moment in an illusionary chariot drawn by sphinxes; and that with a lantern in bright sunshine, he seeks for Truth in a desert.</P>
<P>"Now he has found Her".</P>
