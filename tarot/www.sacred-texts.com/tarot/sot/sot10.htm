<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CARD V.</H3>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CHARIOT.</H1>
<P>I saw a chariot drawn <A HREF="errata.htm#3">dy</A> two sphinxes, one white, the other black. Four pillars supported a blue canopy, on which were scattered five-pointed stars. The Conqueror, clad in steel armour, stood under this canopy guiding the sphinxes. He held a sceptre, on the end of which were a globe, a triangle and a square. A golden pentagram sparkled in his crown. On the front of the chariot there was represented a winged sphere and beneath that the symbol of the mystical lingam, signifying the union of two principles.</P>
<P>"Everything in this picture has a significance. Look and try to understand", said the voice.</P>
<P>"This is Will armed with Knowledge. We see here, however, the wish to achieve, rather than achievement itself. The man in the chariot thought himself a conqueror before he had really conquered, and he believes that victory must come to the conqueror. There are true possibilities in this beautiful conception, but also many false ones. Illusory fires and numerous dangers are hidden here.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></P>
<P>He controls the sphinxes by the power of a magic word, but the tension of his Will may fail and then the magic word will lose its power and he may be devoured by the sphinxes.</P>
<P>This is indeed the Conqueror, but only for the moment; he has not yet conquered Time, and the succeeding moment is unknown to him.</P>
<P>This is the Conqueror, not by love, but by fire and the sword,--a conqueror against whom the conquered may arise. Do you see behind him the towers of the conquered city? Perhaps the flame of uprising burns already there.</P>
<P>And he is unaware that the city vanquished by means of fire and the sword is the city within his own consciousness, that the magic chariot is in himself and that the blood-thirsty sphynxes, also a state of consciousness within, watch his every movement. He has externalized all these phases of his mind and sees them only outside himself. This is his fundamental error. He entered the outer court of the Temple of knowledge, but thinks he has been in the Temple itself. He regarded the rituals of the first tests as initiation, and he mistook for the goddess, the priestess who guarded the threshold. Because of this misconception great perils await him.</P>
<P>Nevertheless it may be that even in his errors and perils the Great Conception lies concealed. He seeks to know and, perhaps, in order to attain, mistakes, dangers and even failures are necessary.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P>Understand that this is the same man whom you saw uniting Heaven and Earth, and again walking across a hot desert to a precipice.</P>
