<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SUN.</H1>
<P>As soon as I perceived the Sun, I understood that It, Itself, is the expression of the Fiery Word and the sign of the Emperor.</P>
<P>The great luminary shone with an intense heat upon the large golden heads of sun-flowers.</P>
<P>And I saw a naked boy, whose head was wreathed with roses, galloping on a white horse and waving a bright-red banner.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</P>
<P>I shut my eyes for a moment and when I opened them again I saw that each ray of the Sun is the sceptre of the Emperor and bears life. And I saw how under the concentration of these rays the mystic flowers of the waters open and receive the rays into themselves and how all Nature is constantly born from the union of two principles.</P>
