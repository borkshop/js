<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE WHEEL OF CHANCE.</H1>
<P>I walked along, absorbed in deep thought, trying to understand the vision of the Angel. And suddenly, as I lifted my head, I saw midway in the sky a huge, revolving circle covered with Kabalistic letters and symbols. The circle turned with terrible velocity, and around it, falling down and flying up, symbolic figures of the serpent and the dog revolved; above it sat an immovable sphinx.</P>
<P>In clouds, on the four quarters of heaven, I saw the four apocalyptical beings, one with the face of a lion, another with the face of a bull, the third with a face of an eagle, and the fourth with the face of a bull. And each of them read an open book.</P>
<P>And I heard the voices of Zarathustra's beasts:--</P>
<P>"All go, all return,"--the wheel of life ever turns. All die, all flourish again,--the year of existence runs eternally.</P>
<P>"All perish, all live again, the same house of existence is ever building. All separate, all meet again, the ring of existence is ever true to itself.</P>
<P>"Existence begins at every moment. Round each "here" rolls "there". The middle is everywhere. The way of eternity is a curve".</P>
