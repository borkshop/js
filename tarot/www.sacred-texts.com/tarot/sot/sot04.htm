<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE HIGH PRIESTESS.</H1>
<P>When I lifted the first veil and entered the outer court of the Temple of Initiation, I saw in half darkness the figure of a woman sitting on a high throne between two pillars of the temple, one white, and one black. Mystery emanated from her and was about her. Sacred symbols shone on her green dress; on her head was a golden tiara surmounted by a two-horned moon; on her knees she held two crossed keys and an open book. Between the two pillars behind the woman hung another veil all embroidered with green leaves and fruit of pomegranate.</P>
<P>And a voice said:</P>
<P>"To enter the Temple one must lift the second veil and pass between the two pillars. And to pass thus, one must obtain possession of the keys, read the book and understand the symbols. Are you able to do this?"</P>
<P>"I would like to be able," I said.</P>

<P>heart, and I understood that she spoke to me, saying without words:</P>
<P>"This is the Hall of Wisdom. No one can reveal it, no one can hide it. Like a flower it must grow and bloom in thy soul. If thou wouldst plant the seed of this flower in thy soul--<I>learn to discern the real from the false. Listen only to the Voice that is soundless... Look only on that which is invisible</I>, and remember that in thee thyself, is the Temple and the gate to it, and the mystery, and the initiation."</P>
