<P>The following additional remarks may be serviceable to the to the inexperienced Cartomancer. They are chiefly taken from Etteilla.</P>
<B><P>24. <I>Knight of Sceptres</B>.--</I>This card is not to be read singly; it means the Departure of the card which follows it. R. Again, notice the card which follows it; if a Woman, Quarrel with a Woman; if Money, then Loss of Money, &amp;c.</P>
<B><P>25. <I>Knave of Sceptres</B>.--</I>R. Notice between what cards the News falls, which will show whence it comes, and of what nature it is.</P>
<B><P>34. <I>Deuce of Sceptres</B>.--</I>R. If the cards fall 49 R., 34 R., you will be surprised by a change. If 47, 49 R., 34 R., it will be happy; but the reverse if they fall 54, 49 R., 34 R.</P>
<B><P>38. <I>The Knight of Cups</B>.--</I>This shows the arrival of the card which follows it, as 38, 54, the arrival of affliction or grief; 38, 39, the visit of a fair young man, etc.</P>
<B><P>43. <I>Seven of Cups</B>.--</I>Explains the card which follows; thus, 43, 30, 33, The idea of attempting some undertaking. This will again be modified by the following cards.</P>
<B><P>44. <I>Six of Cups</B>.--</I>Shows either that what precedes it is past, has occurred already; or if R., what is going to happen.</P>
<B><P>46. <I>Four of Cups</B>.--</I>The following cards might show what the displeasure or anxiety was about; the preceding cards, whence it originated.</P>
<B><P>51. <I>Queen of Swords</B>.--</I>This is not necessarily to be taken by itself; it may signify that the person symbolised by the cards near it has just lost, or is likely soon to lose, wife or husband. In some instances it may merely signify that if two people are married, the one will die some time before the other, but not necessarily that the event will occur immediately.</P>
<B><P>53. <I>Knave of Swords</B>.--</I>R. If 72, 53 R. An unexpected present. If 53 R., 54, unexpected grief, etc.</P>
<B><P>55. <I>Nine of Swords</B>.--</I>R. The card following will show whom or what to distrust, &amp;c..</P>
<B><P>56. <I>Eight of Swords</B>.--</I>R. Shows Treachery or Deceit in the past, and will be explained by the neighbouring cards.</P>
<B><P>57. <I>Seven of Swords</B>.--</I>R. The cards which come next will show whether it will be good to follow the advice given or not. Also, the preceding cards will show from whom, and why, the advice comes.</P>
<B><P>60. <I>Four of Swords</B>.--</I>R. The cards near will show whether it is health or money that requires care.</P>
<B><P>61. <I>Three of Swords</B>.--</I>R. May show simply that something is lost, or mislaid for a time.</P>
<B><P>62. <I>Deuce of Swords</B>.--</I>R. If confirmed by the other cards may simply mean that the friends are not <I>of much use </I>to the inquirer in the matter under consideration.</P>
<B><P>65. <I>Queen of Pentacles</B>.--</I>R. (If this card does not signify any particular <I>person</I>). If 65 R., 31 R., It is not said that there will be a Lawsuit. If 31 R., 65 R., If you gain your case you won't be much the better for it.</P>
<B><P>67. <I>Knave of Pentacles</B>.--</I>R. Consult the following cards to see in what the person is prodigal. If 67 R., 57 R., it may simply mean that the person is too fond of giving advice, intermeddles too much with other people's business.</P>
<B><P>71. <I>Seven of Pentacles</B>.--</I>R. The next card will show the reason of the anxiety, and so on.</P>
<B><P>73. <I>Five of Pentacles</B>.--</I>Shows simply that there is some one whom the person loves.</P>
<P>The Court-Cards, and especially the Kings and Queens, may be taken to represent persons; in this case their additional meaning should not be read. The Swords represent very dark people; Pentacles, those not so dark; Cups, rather fair people; Wands or Sceptres, those much fairer, and so on. Many Wands together might signify feasting, many Cups lovemaking, Swords quarrelling and trouble, Coins or Pentacles money.</P>
<P>Where the mode of reading the cards requires that the person consulting should be represented, he should take one of the Kings to represent himself, according to his complexion. If a lady consults the cards, let her take one of the Queens; if she be rather fair, the Queen of Cups; if she be very fair, the Queen of Wands or Sceptres. If the inquirer be quite a youth or a boy, let him take one of the Knights; if a very young girl, let her take the Knave, etc. Etteilla's plan was to take two of the Keys for Significators, that answering to the Pope for a man, that answering to the High Priestess for a woman; but I do not think this is so well. The worst of Etteilla's system is that he so completely destroys the meanings of the Keys in his attempted rearrangement of them, as to make them practically useless for higher occult purposes.</P>
