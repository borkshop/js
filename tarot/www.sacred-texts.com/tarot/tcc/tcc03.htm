<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Sun</H1>
<P>The Sun card line art has an obvious glitch which appears in both the Pamela A and US Games decks. This is an additional wavy line just to the right of the Roman numeral XIX at the top of the card. This is a sure sign that the two decks are essentially identical. If the US Games deck was redrawn, this superfluous line would have raised the eyebrows of any competent artist.</P>
<P>There <I>is</I> one difference in the line art on this card: note the break in the Sun's left eyebrow in Pamela A--the left eyebrow line is solid in the USGS deck. Whether this was introduced deliberately is up for speculation.</P>
<P>It is worth taking a close look at some of the shading in the Pamela A Sun card, particularly on the horse and the flag. This is washed-out in the US Games version; there is a much better sense of depth in Pamela-A. There also appear to be subtle variations in the skin tone of the baby which are completely lost in the USGS version; again, this appears to be the case on many of the other cards.</P>
