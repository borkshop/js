# Cascading DOMgeon Template

This is a starter template for a modern browser-native roguelike dungeon game.

NOTE: at present, it's coupled to the borkshop/js repository
structure; temlating a standalone repository is not yet sorted out.

# Usage

- `cp -a packages/cdom-template packages/your-thing`
- `$EDITOR packages/your-thing/package.json` and rename a few things
- `$EDITOR packages/your-thing/src/index.html` and have fun!

TODO automate the above with a template creation tool of some ilk...
